;; Description: Dempster-Shafer belief system implementation.
;; Represents belief as [Bel, Pl] intervals where the width (Pl - Bel)
;; captures remaining ignorance explicitly. Each interval is a basic
;; probability assignment over the dichotomous frame {H, not-H}
;; (m(H)=Bel, m(not-H)=1-Pl, m(Theta)=Pl-Bel), and COMBINE-BELIEFS applies
;; Dempster's rule of combination with explicit conflict (K) renormalization.
;; Restricting the frame to a single hypothesis and its negation (the Barnett
;; simplification) keeps combination O(1) and avoids power-set mass functions
;; while remaining faithful DS on that frame -- hence the "(simplified)" name.

(defun ds-combine (a b)
  "Combine two DS beliefs A and B for the SAME single hypothesis via Dempster's
   rule of combination on the dichotomous frame {H, not-H}.

   Each [Bel, Pl] interval encodes a basic probability assignment over that
   frame:
     m(H)     = Bel        — mass committed to the hypothesis
     m(not-H) = 1 - Pl     — mass committed against it
     m(Theta) = Pl - Bel   — uncommitted mass (ignorance)

   Dempster's rule intersects the focal elements of the two BPAs, tallies the
   conflict mass K (the mass that lands on the empty set, H and not-H being
   disjoint), and renormalizes the survivors by 1 - K:

     K       = m1(H)*m2(not-H) + m1(not-H)*m2(H)
     m12(H)  = [m1(H)m2(H) + m1(H)m2(Theta) + m1(Theta)m2(H)] / (1 - K)
     m12(nH) = [m1(nH)m2(nH) + m1(nH)m2(Theta) + m1(Theta)m2(nH)] / (1 - K)

   This is genuine Dempster-Shafer, restricted to singleton hypotheses (the
   Barnett simplification) so it stays O(1) per combination and needs no
   power-set machinery. When there is no disconfirming evidence
   (m(not-H) = 0 on both sides) K collapses to 0 and the rule reduces to the
   familiar Bel = a + b - a*b, Pl = 1 form, so confirmatory-only scenarios are
   numerically unchanged.

   A PLAIN function over two ds-belief structs, independent of *BELIEF-SYSTEM*.
   COMBINE-BELIEFS (the DS method) delegates here; the antibiogram overlay's
   susceptibility combination also calls it natively — a susceptibility's
   data-sparseness is orthogonal to the CF-vs-DS diagnostic algebra, so it must
   NOT dispatch on the active system (which under CF has no ds-belief method and
   would error). See susceptibility-belief-design.md decision C."
