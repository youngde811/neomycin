# Next Steps: Lisa/LLM Integration Research

## Context

> **Note:** This section describes the state *before* the 2026-07-02 work
> below. The rulebase has since grown from 6 → 27 rules and Dempster-Shafer
> has been added as a second (now default) belief system, upgraded to real
> Dempster combination on 2026-07-03 — see the Progress sections at the end.

Phase 1 (HTTP bridge) and Phase 2 (Claude tool-use clinician driver) are complete. The system demonstrates a hybrid architecture where Claude handles natural-language interaction and Lisa handles deterministic forward-chaining inference with certainty factors and full rule traceability. At the time of writing, the MYCIN rulebase has 6 rules covering a narrow slice of infectious disease identification.

We want to push this further — not toward a full MYCIN port (clinically irrelevant today, and the backward-chaining mismatch makes it impractical at scale), but toward a richer demonstration of what the hybrid architecture can do.

## Environment

- Development on personal Mac, using the Anthropic-protocol client (points at api.anthropic.com by default; set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to route through an internal wrapper)
- Branch: master (or feature branches as needed)
- Driver: `src/llm/claude/driver.py` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## Three Research Threads

### 1. Expand the Rulebase (6 → 25-30 rules)

**Goal**: Enough rules to produce genuinely interesting multi-hypothesis dialogues where `/partial-matches` surfaces competing diagnoses and belief factors combine across evidence paths.

**Approach**:
- Author rules *for* forward-chaining (not translated from backward-chaining MYCIN originals)
- Cover more organism classes: add fungi, viruses, parasites beyond just bacteria
- Add differential paths where the same evidence supports multiple hypotheses at different confidence levels
- Include rules that combine — e.g., two independent pieces of evidence both pointing to the same organism, so the belief algebra gets exercised
- Add patient-context rules (immunocompromised, recent travel, hospital-acquired vs community-acquired)

**Success looks like**: A diagnostic conversation where Claude navigates 3-4 competing hypotheses, asks discriminating questions guided by partial-matches, and the final conclusion shows belief combination from multiple fired rules.

**Files to modify**: `examples/mycin.lisp`, `src/llm/claude/system-prompt.md` (update ontology), `src/llm/claude/tools.json` (if new fact types added)

### 2. Belief Algebra Review

**Goal**: Determine whether Lisa's current certainty factor implementation is the best choice, or whether a different weighting algebra would produce more explainable and intuitive results.

**Current state**: Lisa's `src/belief-systems/` implements Shortliffe/Buchanan certainty factors (CF). The `belief` package provides `belief-factor` and `combine-beliefs`.

**Known issues with classic CF**:
- The combination formula can behave counterintuitively with conflicting evidence
- The -1 to +1 range with asymmetric combination was designed for a specific era
- Order-independent but not always intuitive to clinicians or end users

**Alternatives to explore**:
- **Dempster-Shafer theory** — handles uncertainty and ignorance separately; good for combining independent evidence sources
- **Probabilistic soft logic** — continuous truth values [0,1] with well-defined combination semantics
- **Simplified Bayesian** — prior/posterior updating that Lisa's forward-chaining could drive (assert priors, rules update posteriors)
- **Weighted evidence accumulation** — simpler than full Bayes, more intuitive than CF

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Explainability (can Claude narrate *why* the confidence is what it is?)
- Behavior with conflicting evidence
- Behavior when multiple rules support the same conclusion
- Implementation complexity within Lisa's existing architecture

**Approach**: Start with a deep read of `src/belief-systems/`. Understand what's there. Then prototype an alternative algebra alongside it (not replacing — Lisa should support pluggable belief systems). Compare results on the same scenario with both algebras.

### 3. Architecture Validation

**Goal**: Confirm the bridge/driver/partial-matches loop scales to a richer rulebase without degradation in dialogue quality or explainability.

**Things to watch for**:
- Does `/partial-matches` return too many candidates when the rulebase grows? (May need ranking or filtering)
- Does Claude get confused choosing what to ask next with many competing hypotheses?
- Does the rule trace remain explainable when 5-10 rules fire instead of 1-2?
- Does the system prompt need restructuring to handle a larger ontology?

**Approach**: This thread is exercised implicitly by threads 1 and 2. Run real diagnostic conversations after each expansion and note where the architecture creaks.

## Suggested Sequence

1. **Start with thread 2** — read `src/belief-systems/`, understand the current implementation, form an opinion before adding complexity
2. **Then thread 1** — expand the rulebase with the chosen (or dual) belief algebra in mind
3. **Thread 3** — continuous validation as we go

## Progress (2026-07-02)

### Completed

- **Thread 2 — Belief algebra**: Pluggable belief-system protocol
  (`src/belief-systems/protocol.lisp`) landed with two implementations:
  certainty factors (`certainty-factors/`) and simplified Dempster-Shafer
  (`dempster-shafer/`). Convenience switch: `(belief:use-system
  :certainty-factors | :dempster-shafer)`.
- **Thread 1 — Rulebase**: MYCIN base expanded from 6 → 15 rules with new
  fact types (`hospital-acquired`, `recent-travel`, `white-blood-count`,
  `infection-site`) and new demonstration functions (`culture-1a`,
  `culture-3`).
- **Bridge/driver wire-up for DS**: `LISA_BELIEF_SYSTEM` env var selects the
  system at bridge startup (**Dempster-Shafer is the default**); `POST
  /reset` accepts optional `belief_system` for per-session overrides;
  `/conclusions` emits `{bel, pl, ignorance}` under DS and bare numbers
  under CF; every response includes the active belief-system name.
- **Configurable session capture in the driver**: markdown transcripts land
  in `./sessions/` by default. CLI flags `--transcript` /
  `--no-transcript`, `--transcript-dir`, `--transcript-file`,
  `--transcript-verbosity {minimal,normal,full}`; matching env vars
  `LISA_TRANSCRIPT*`; runtime `transcript on|off|where` prompts.
- **Refreshed tool schemas + system prompt**: `tools.json` covers all 15
  rules' fact types and the `belief_system` param on reset;
  `system-prompt.md` narrates the CF vs DS output shapes and gives
  hedging guidance for wide DS ignorance intervals.
- **Clinician scenarios**: `docs/clinician-scenarios.md` — 7 vignettes
  covering every rule and highlighting the CF-vs-DS distinction.

- **User-facing runbook**: `docs/runbook.md` — narrative walkthrough covering
  bridge/driver startup, five hands-on demonstrations (belief combination,
  partial-matches-driven questioning, mid-session belief-system switching,
  DS ambiguous-evidence propagation, DS ignorance narrowing), transcript
  configuration, and a fact/rule reference.

### Remaining threads

- **Thread 3 — Architecture validation**: partially exercised by the 18-rule
  base; still worth deliberate stress testing with longer conversations and
  more competing hypotheses.

## Progress (2026-07-03)

### Dempster-Shafer: from noisy-OR to real Dempster combination

A review of the "simplified" DS implementation found that its `combine-beliefs`
was the identical noisy-OR formula CF uses (`a + b − a*b`), with plausibility
pinned at 1.0 because **every rule in the base was confirmatory**. Empirically,
DS and CF produced identical numbers on every scenario, and `culture-2` (the
ambiguous-gram-stain showcase) actually *crashed* under DS — an explicit
numeric `:belief` was stored as a raw float and blew up `conjoin-beliefs`.

Fixed end-to-end (option B — Dempster on the dichotomous frame `{H, ¬H}`, the
Barnett simplification, rather than full power-set mass functions):

- **Input normalization** (`src/core/rete.lisp`): an explicit numeric `:belief`
  now routes through the active system's `normalize-belief`, so DS stores a
  `ds-belief` interval instead of a bare number. Fixes the `culture-2` crash.
- **Real Dempster's rule** (`src/belief-systems/dempster-shafer/`): each
  `[Bel, Pl]` interval is a BPA over `{H, ¬H}` (`m(H)=Bel`, `m(¬H)=1−Pl`,
  `m(Θ)=Pl−Bel`); `combine-beliefs` intersects focal elements, tallies conflict
  `K`, and renormalizes by `1−K`. `weaken-belief` now accepts negative rule
  factors, placing mass on `¬H` (disconfirming evidence). Confirmatory-only
  cases have `K=0` and reduce to the old numbers, so `culture-1`/`1a`/`3` are
  unchanged.
- **Three disconfirming rules** (`examples/mycin.lisp`, 15 → 18): a
  contradictory stain or oxygen requirement argues *against* a hypothesis.
  These are what make DS and CF diverge — under DS, conflict pulls plausibility
  below 1.0; under CF it collapses to a single lowered number.

Result: `culture-2` no longer crashes and now genuinely separates the two
algebras (DS bacteroides `[0.60, 0.83]` vs CF `0.52`). Docs (runbook Demo 4,
Scenario 7, system prompt, ExampleRulebases sample run) refreshed with real
engine output.

A high-effort code-review pass then hardened the change:

- **Disconfirming strength attribution** (`src/core/rete.lisp`): a rule that
  re-asserts a fact it also matches (the disconfirming rules) was folding the
  hypothesis's *own* prior belief into the premise-strength conjunction, so
  ruling-out force tracked how strongly the hypothesis was already held rather
  than the contradicting observation. The conclusion fact is now excluded from
  its own premise list. Showcase scenarios (gram carries explicit confidence)
  are unchanged; the plain-assertion path is now correct.
- **Defensive clamps** (`dempster-shafer.lisp`): `weaken-belief` and
  `combine-beliefs` clamp their outputs to a valid `[bel ≤ pl] ⊆ [0,1]`
  interval, so an out-of-range rule `:belief` or a malformed input interval
  can no longer leak invalid masses into `/conclusions`.

### Still open

- The disconfirming `gram-neg-argues-against-gram-pos` and
  `aerobic-argues-against-anaerobe` rules aren't yet exercised by a written
  scenario (they need a contradiction against a live hypothesis) — worth a
  dedicated vignette.
- Full power-set DS (set-valued / taxonomic hypotheses) remains deferred; the
  dichotomous-frame simplification is the right cost/benefit point for now.
