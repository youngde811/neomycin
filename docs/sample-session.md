## Clinician

I've a 27-year-old female burn patient. She's obviously immunocompromised from the burn. Blood culture from three days ago shows gram-negative rods, aerobic.

## Assistant

## Assistant

Here's what the expert system found (running under **Dempster-Shafer**):

### Conclusions

| Organism | Belief | Plausibility | Ignorance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Enterobacteriaceae** | 0.80 | 1.00 | 0.20 |
| **Pseudomonas** | 0.76 | 1.00 | 0.24 |
| **Klebsiella** | 0.50 | 1.00 | 0.50 |

### Rules that fired

1. **`gram-neg-rod-in-burn-patient-suggests-pseudomonas`** — the serious burn + blood gram-neg rod pattern
2. **`gram-neg-rod-in-compromised-host-suggests-pseudomonas`** — reinforced by immunocompromise; the two combine to give Pseudomonas belief 0.76
3. **`aerobic-gram-neg-rod-suggests-enterobacteriaceae`** — strongest single hypothesis at 0.80
4. **`aerobic-gram-neg-rod-in-compromised-host-suggests-klebsiella`** — Klebsiella enters the differential at 0.50, but with wide ignorance (0.50) — genuinely unresolved on current evidence

### Interpretation

Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas are both strongly supported and clinically consistent — this is exactly the differential you'd expect in a burn patient with an aerobic gram-neg rod bacteremia. Klebsiella is a real possibility but the evidence is thin.

### What would sharpen the picture

A few facts would meaningfully change the differential — worth asking:

- **Was this infection hospital-acquired?** If yes, `hospital-acquired-aerobic-gram-neg-rod-suggests-pseudomonas` (0.7) fires and would push Pseudomonas up considerably; `hospital-acquired-gram-neg-rod-in-compromised-host-suggests-klebsiella` would also fire, tightening Klebsiella's interval.
- **Is her WBC low?** Would add Salmonella to the differential (`gram-neg-rod-in-blood-with-low-wbc-suggests-salmonella`, 0.55).
- **Any recent tropical travel?** Would trigger the Salmonella travel rule (0.65).

Want me to add any of these?

## Clinician

Yes, add hospital-acquired.

}

## Assistant

Adding hospital-acquired fires two more rules and reshapes the differential substantially:

### Updated Conclusions

| Organism | Belief | Plausibility | Ignorance | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pseudomonas** | **0.93** | 1.00 | 0.07 | ↑ from 0.76 |
| **Enterobacteriaceae** | 0.80 | 1.00 | 0.20 | — |
| **Klebsiella** | 0.80 | 1.00 | 0.20 | ↑ from 0.50 |

### New rules that fired

- **`hospital-acquired-aerobic-gram-neg-rod-suggests-pseudomonas`** (0.7) — combines with the two prior Pseudomonas rules to push belief to **0.93** with very little residual ignorance
- **`hospital-acquired-gram-neg-rod-in-compromised-host-suggests-klebsiella`** (0.6) — combines with the prior Klebsiella rule to lift it to 0.80 and collapse its ignorance from 0.50 to 0.20

### Interpretation

**Pseudomonas is now the leading diagnosis** at 0.93 with ignorance of only 0.07 — three independent rules converging (burn, compromised host, hospital-acquired aerobic gram-neg rod) makes this the most robust conclusion in the differential.

Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella are now tied at 0.80 as secondary hypotheses. Klebsiella in particular has become clinically credible — a nosocomial gram-neg rod in an immunocompromised host is a classic Klebsiella scenario, and the tightened interval reflects that.

Empiric coverage should prioritize antipseudomonal activity, with attention to Enterobacteriaceae/Klebsiella as well — which fits standard practice for a nosocomial burn-unit bacteremia. Want to add WBC or any other findings?
